/*  DEFINITION:
a non-linear data structure where nodes are organized in a hierarchy


TREE TRAVERSAL
In-order: left -> root -> right
Post-order: left -> right -> root
pre-order: root -> left -> right (creates a copy of the tree)
 */

/* CARACTERISTICS
- top of the tree is known as root node
- leaf nodes are the ones at the bottom of the tree
- branch nodes are in the middle. They have incoming and outgoing egdes
- parent: any node with outgoing edges
- child: any node with incoming edges
nodes can parents/children.
- siblings: any two children that shares the same parent
- subtree: a smaller tree held within a larger tree
- size of tree = # of nodes
- depth of tree = # of edges below the root node
- height of tree = # of edges above futhest leaf node
